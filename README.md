# The Purpose of a Feasibility Report
A feasibility report focuses on the business apsect of project design, meaning that the purpose of the report is to establish the different variables involved with the business venture and how it will be accepted in the target market demographic for your product. The report also determines factors that will make the business venture a success. The feasibility study will also explore the seperate markets that their target audience may be located in. Alternative target audiences should also be established and have their possible markets explored. Along with this, another factor that needs to be investigated is how acceptable the product is to the possible target audience, for example designing variations of your product and investigating the price that the target consumers are willing to pay.
